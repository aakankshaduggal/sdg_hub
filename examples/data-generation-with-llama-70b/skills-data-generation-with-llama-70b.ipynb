    "The biggest change in this improved workflow is that we use the Llama model to directly classify samples into skill routes using guided choices. This replaces the earlier approach where LoRA adapters were used with Mixtral for routing/classification. This new method leverages Llama's strong multi-class classification ability and simplifies the workflow by removing the need for adapter-based routing.\n",

    "* `synth-skills-llama3.3.yaml` for the first stage (e.g., initial data generation)\n",
    "* `agentic-skills-llama3.3.yaml` for the second stage (e.g., skill routing, critique, revision etc)\n",
    "2. **Initialize the SDG pipeline with both flows:**\n",
    "* Pass both flow configurations as a list of Pipeline objects to a single SDG instance.\n",
    "* Set processing parameters such as batch_size, num_workers, and save_freq.\n",
    "3. **Run the chained pipeline:**\n",
    "The SDG pipeline will automatically process your dataset through each stage in sequence, passing the output of one pipeline as the input to the next.\n",

       " 'judgement': \"Both assistants provide a markdown table as requested, but they differ in detail and additional information. Assistant A's table is straightforward, listing the features, bugs, and support experiences. However, it lacks depth in the support experience column, simply marking it as negative or neutral without elaboration. Assistant B, on the other hand, provides a more detailed table with specific comments on the support experience, including both positive and negative aspects. Additionally, Assistant B includes a secondary table detailing the support interactions, which offers a clearer picture of the issues faced and the outcomes of the support requests. Assistant B also provides a summary that encapsulates the user's experience, highlighting both the satisfactory and unsatisfactory aspects, and suggests areas for improvement. This comprehensive approach makes Assistant B's response more informative and helpful.\",\n",
